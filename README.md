## About

This application was developed as part of an DIO/TQI Bootcamp challenge. Originally it was intended to create a query app using the GitHub API as means to practice with React Hooks. I chose to propose a different solution for the following reasons:

* Because of the name;
* I wanted to do something from scratch;
* I'm using this opportunity to learn new things;

## Features

* Dynamic support for three languages (Portuguese, English e Mandarin);
* Combination of two public APIs in order to compose this application: [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/) (authors and books) and [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) (author pictures)

## How to Install and Run
