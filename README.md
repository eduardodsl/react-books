# React Books
React Books is a simple [OpenLibrary API](https://openlibrary.org/) client written for the DIO/TQI Bootcamp. The original challenge suggested to develop a react app for the Github API, I decided to play with a different one.

## How to Install and Run
After clonning the repository, just run `npm run` and you are good to go.

## Configuration
There is no additional configuration beyond the .env file already shipped with this code.
